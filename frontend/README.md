# Frontend Setup (React)

This section provides instructions for setting up and configuring the frontend of your existing React application.

## Installation and Setup

To get your existing React frontend up and running, follow these steps:

1. `Node.js Installation`: Ensure that you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your machine. You can download the latest version of Node.js from the [official website](https://nodejs.org/en).

2. `Install Dependencies`: Open a terminal and navigate to your existing React app directory.Then, install the required dependencies using npm:

```bash
    npm install
```

3. `Configuration`: Create a `.env` file in the root of your project directory if it doesn't exist. Add the following lines to enable HTTPS using the provided SSL certificate and key:

```bash
    HTTPS=true
    SSL_CRT_FILE=ssl/server.crt
    SSL_KEY_FILE=ssl/server.key
```

Make sure you have the `server.crt` and `server.key` files inside the `ssl` folder in your project directory.

## Developing the User Interface

With your dependencies installed and configuration set up, you can focus on developing the user interface of your frontend application. The src directory contains your main codebase, including the entry point App.js and any components you create.

Edit and create components as needed to build the desired user interface. React provides powerful tools for building interactive and dynamic UI components.

## Running the Application

To start your frontend application, run the following command in your terminal while inside your project directory:

```bash
    npm start
```

The development server will start, and you can access your application in your browser at `https://localhost:3000`.

## Accessing the Application

With the development server running, your frontend application will be accessible in your browser. The provided SSL configuration enables HTTPS for secure communication.

Navigate to `https://localhost:3000` to access your application securely.

## Conclusion

By following these steps, you'll successfully set up and configure the frontend of your existing React application. You can now work on developing the user interface, interact with backend APIs, and ensure secure communication through HTTPS with the provided SSL certificate and key.
