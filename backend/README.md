# Backend Setup (Spring Boot)

This section provides guidance on setting up and configuring the backend of your application, which is built using Spring Boot, a popular Java framework for building web applications.

## Installation and Setup

To get started with the backend, follow these steps:

1. `Download and Install Java`: Ensure that you have Java JDK (Java Development Kit) installed on your machine. You can download the latest version of Java from the [official website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/).

2. `Download and Install Maven`: Maven is used as a build tool and dependency management system for Spring Boot projects. You can download and install Maven from the [official website](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi).

3. `Clone the Repository`: Clone or download the repository containing your Spring Boot backend code.

## Configuration

Before running the Spring Boot application, you need to configure some properties to ensure it works correctly with your environment. The configuration properties are stored in the `application.properties` file located in the src/main/resources directory of your Spring Boot project.

Open the `application.properties` file and provide values for the required properties. These properties might include database connection details, server port, security settings, and more. Make sure to replace placeholder values with actual values specific to your environment.

## Running the Application

To run the Spring Boot application using a GUI:

1. `Import the Project`: Import your Spring Boot project into the IDE.

2. `Build and Run`: Right-click on your project in the Project Explorer, then select "Run As" > "Spring Boot App". This will build and run your application.

## Accessing the Application

With the backend up and running, you can access the application's APIs using the defined endpoints. These endpoints might include routes for user authentication, data retrieval, and more. Refer to your application's documentation or codebase to learn about the available API endpoints and how to interact with them.

## Conclusion

By following these steps, you can set up, configure, and run the backend of your application built using Spring Boot. Proper configuration of application properties ensures that your backend works seamlessly with your environment, and running the application using a GUI simplifies the development process.
