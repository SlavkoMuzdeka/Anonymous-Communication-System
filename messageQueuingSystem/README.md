# Message Queuing System Setup(Spring Boot)

This section provides guidance on setting up and configuring the message queuing system of your application, which is built using Spring Boot, a popular Java framework for building web applications.

## Installation and Setup

To get started with the backend, follow these steps:

1. `Download and Install Java`: Ensure that you have Java JDK (Java Development Kit) installed on your machine. You can download the latest version of Java from the [official website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/).

2. `Download and Install Maven`: Maven is used as a build tool and dependency management system for Spring Boot projects. You can download and install Maven from the [official website](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi).

3. `Clone the Repository`: Clone or download the repository containing your Spring Boot backend code.

## Running the Application

To run the Spring Boot application using a GUI:

1. `Import the Project`: Import your Spring Boot project into the IDE.

2. `Build and Run`: Right-click on your project in the Project Explorer, then select "Run As" > "Spring Boot App". This will build and run your application.

## Conclusion

By following these steps, you can set up, configure, and run the message queuing system of your application built using Spring Boot. Proper configuration of application properties ensures that your backend works seamlessly with your environment, and running the application using a GUI simplifies the development process.
